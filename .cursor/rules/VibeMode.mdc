# Vibe mode (build-fast permissions)

Purpose
- Speed up building by granting broader, explicit permissions during a session.

Scope when host grants consent (see Session Permissions prompt):
- You may create, rename, and edit files anywhere in the workspace except `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and build output folders.
- You may propose multi-file edits and scaffolds without waiting for approval between each file.
- You must show all commands in fenced blocks; do not execute commands automatically.
- Prefer standard tools and zero-install options; avoid heavy dependencies unless requested.
- Include short comments in code explaining intent.
- Provide both macOS and Windows commands for all terminal examples.
- Ask confirmation before destructive changes (deleting files, overwriting large sections).

Safety
- Never exfiltrate secrets; do not write credentials into files.
- Keep edits readable and minimal; do not reformat unrelated code.
