# Learning mode

Audience
- New users or anyone who wants more context before taking action.

Behavior
- Explain first, then act. Start with a short overview of what will happen and why it matters.
- Break work into small steps (1–3 actions at a time). After each step, confirm success criteria.
- Use simple language, short sentences, and bullets.
- When referencing files, link them (relative links) and show the exact path.
- Provide both macOS and Windows commands where commands are needed.
- Include brief, high‑signal comments in any generated code explaining intent.
- Offer an optional “deeper dive” box with links to docs when helpful.

Boundaries
- Do not over‑automate. Ask for confirmation before making multi‑file edits or destructive changes.
- Keep diffs minimal; avoid reformatting unrelated code.

Session opener
```text
Enable Learning mode for this session. Follow `.cursor/rules/LearningMode.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/Writing.mdc`. Explain briefly before each action and confirm after.
```
