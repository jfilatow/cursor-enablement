## Cursor Basics — facilitator runbook (60 minutes)

Use this to host a live session. Speak in your own words; keep it hands‑on.

### Before the session (5 minutes)
- Ask attendees to open this repo in Cursor and sign in to Cursor Business.
- Extensions: open Extensions view (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+X, macOS: Cmd+Shift+X). Recommend a preview extension; optional GitLens, Error Lens, Path Intellisense, MarkdownLint.
- Verify terminal access:
  - macOS Terminal: Command+Space → Terminal.
  - Windows: Win+R → `cmd` (Command Prompt) or Win+X → Windows PowerShell.

### 0–10 min — Orientation
- Show the top‑level `README.md` and the section list.
- Where to find things (use menus, not shortcuts):
  - Settings: gear icon bottom‑left.
  - Sidebar: View → Appearance → Show/Hide Side Bar.
  - Terminal: View → Terminal.
  - Full screen: View → Appearance → Full Screen.
  - Zen mode: View → Appearance → Zen Mode.

### 10–20 min — UI tour
- Open `01-basics/README.md`. Explain that all artifacts are generated via prompts.
- Demonstrate Chat, Composer, tabs, and where rules live `.cursor/rules/`.

### 20–35 min — Attach docs and use rules
- Attach the top‑level `README.md` and `01-basics/README.md`.
- Paste docs links for context: Quickstart, Concepts, Working with documentation.
- In chat: ask for a 3‑sentence summary and the next action.

### 35–55 min — Create `progress.md`
- Paste the standardized prompt from `01-basics/README.md` → Step 6.
- Have everyone create `progress.md` and preview it with the extension.
- Optional stretch: ask the agent to propose a plan for a simple viewer, no code yet.

### 55–60 min — Recap
- Ask attendees to check two items as done and add one stretch goal.
- Point to the next section `02-prompting-basics`.

### Troubleshooting callouts
- If commands are needed, provide both OS versions; see prompts in `01-basics/prompts.md`.
- If attachments are large, summarize first and attach excerpts.
