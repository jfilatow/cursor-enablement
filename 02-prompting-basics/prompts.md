## Ordered prompts for 02 â€” prompting basics

### 1) Define outcomes
```text
Read ../README.md and ../01-basics/README.md. In 3 bullets, state what I should achieve in 02-prompting-basics. Keep it concrete.
```

### 2) Draft reusable prompts
```text
Propose 3 reusable prompts for my role. Each should include goal, constraints, required inputs, and expected output format.
```

### 3) Iterate with follow-ups
```text
Using prompt #1, show a short follow-up that narrows scope and improves quality. Explain the delta in one line.
```

### 4) Capture before/after
```text
Create a before/after snippet for prompt #1 showing improvement. Keep total under 20 lines.
```

### 5) Next steps
```text
Suggest one improvement to prompt #2 and one metric to judge success next time.
```
