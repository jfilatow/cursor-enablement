# Build-your-own viewer (no starter code)

- This folder is intentionally empty.
- In Basics, you will only plan a simple way to visualize `progress.json`.
- You will generate the viewer later by prompting Cursor; do not add prewritten solutions here.

See `../prompts.md` -> "Plan a simple viewer".
